= Summary

This example demonstrates:

* How to define a vdb and transfer data from a SalesForce database. Please note other data source types are also possible
* How to use Thorntail to configure VDB, configure data sources and run Teiid as a Thorntail uber jar.

= Building the Example
The following sections define steps to code and run the example.

== Data Source Setup
Since SalesForce is cloud SaaS based service, there is no setup. Just gather your credentials to connect. 

== Project Setup

IMPORTANT: This example requires Java 8 JDK or greater and Maven 3.3.x.

The project is a maven project with `vdb` packaging. This is special packaging developed for Teiid based VDB. The `pom.xml` is the key file for building a Throntail based application. To enable `vdb` packing you need to add following to your pom.xml 

[source,xml]
----
<packaging>vdb</packaging>

<build>
	<plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.teiid</groupId>
        <artifactId>vdb-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.1</version>
      </plugin>	
	</plugins>
</build>
----

This project also requires the `thorntail-maven-plugin` to build a uber jar with `-thorntail.jar` extension, for that add the following

----
<build>
	<plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
        <artifactId>thorntail-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${version.thorntail}</version>
      </plugin>	
	</plugins>
</build>
---- 

This project also depends on following dependencies, namely Teiid and Salesforce translators

----
<!-- This adds dependency on Teiid Fraction in Thorntail -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
  <artifactId>teiid</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- This adds dependency for Teiid's JDBC translator -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
  <artifactId>teiid-salesforce-41</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

if you want your Teiid instance to expose OData API, then add the following dependency

----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
  <artifactId>odata</artifactId>
</dependency> 
----

That completes the defining the `pom.xml`, for complete pom.xml see the example. Now we need to define the VDB. 

== VDB Setup

Thorntail based Teiid currently only supports XML/DDL based VDBS with -vdb.xml extension. Develop your VDB completely using Designer perhaps or simply using a text editor, once done place the VDB file in `src/main/vdb` folder.  

== Data Source Configuration
Data Source configuration is defined by Thorntail. You can see more information about this at http://docs.wildfly-thorntail.io/2018.5.0/#_resource_adapters

This example provides a sample data configuration file in `src/main/resources` directory with name `project-defaults.yml` with content 

----
swarm:
  resource-adapters:
    resource-adapters:
      sfDS:
        module: org.jboss.teiid.resource-adapter.salesforce-41
        transaction-support: NoTransaction
        connection-definitions:
          sfDS:
            class-name: org.teiid.resource.adapter.salesforce.SalesForceManagedConnectionFactory
            jndi-name: java:/sfDS
            enabled: true
            use-java-context: true
            config-properties:
              URL:
                value: https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/40.0
              username:
                value: user
              password:
                value: pass
----

IMPORTANT: Make sure `jndi-name` configured here matches with that of what you defined in the VDB's salesforce model.  

Now development/configuration is done.

== Build and Run the project

you can build the project by issuing the following the command

----
mvn clean package
---- 

this should build the project and if everything went well then it will create a  jar file with `-thorntail.jar` file in the `target` directory. You can run the application by running

----
java -jar target/salesforce-as-datasource-VERSION-thorntail.jar 
----  

You should hit an authentication error from salesforce if you have not changed the username/password in the project yaml.

You may pass values in the command line as well

----
java -jar target/salesforce-as-datasource-VERSION-thorntail.jar -Dswarm.resource-adapters.resource-adapters.sfDS.connection-definitions.sfDS.config-properties.username=foo 
----  

== Query Demonstrations

Now you can use any SQL client tools like SQuirreL or your own Java application and use Teiid JDBC driver and connect to the `saleforce` VDB and issue commands like (see simpleclient project for sample java code for client)

----
select * from account;
----

and see results as
----
CST01002	Joseph	Smith
CST01003	Nicholas	Ferguson
CST01004	Jane	Aire
CST01005	Charles	Jones
CST01006	Virginia	Jefferson
CST01007	Ralph	Bacon
----

If you enabled the OData, then you can use your browser and visit

----
http://localhost:8080/odata4/salesforce.1/sf/account?$format=json
----

You will see results like
