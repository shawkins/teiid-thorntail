= Summary

This example demonstrates:

* How to define a vdb and transfer data from a relational database. Please note other data source types are also possible
* How to use Thorntail to configure VDB, configure data sources and run Teiid as a Thorntail uber jar.
* Shows how access OData interface running Teiid with Thorntail.

= Building the Example
The following sections define steps to code and run the example.

== Data Source Setup
IMPORTANT: While you can run and interact with this example on our local host, it requires that you also have a database installed and configured. This example shows an example where a MySQL docker instance is created and populated with some test data. If you are working with your own database (or any other source) skip this step.

=== Start a MySQL Server Instance
Starting a MySQL instance is simple, run the following commands. Note, the commands are written for *unix environments.
----
$sudo docker pull mysql
$sudo docker run --name accounts -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mysql
----

where `accounts` is the name you want to assign to your container, my-secret-pw is the password to be set for the MySQL root user and expose the port 3306 on to your localhost. To populate with some test data run the following command

----
docker exec -i accounts mysql -uroot -pmy-secret-pw < sql/customer-schema.sql
----


== Project Setup

IMPORTANT: This example requires Java 8 JDK or greater and Maven 3.3.x.

The project is a maven project with `vdb` packaging. This is special packaging developed for Teiid based VDB. The `pom.xml` is the key file for building a Thorntail based application. To enable `vdb` packing you need to add following to your pom.xml 

[source,xml]
----
<packaging>vdb</packaging>

<build>
	<plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.teiid</groupId>
        <artifactId>vdb-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.1</version>
		... see more in pom.xml file		
      </plugin>	
	</plugins>
</build>
----

This project also requires the `thorntail-maven-plugin` to build a uber jar with `-thorntail.jar` extension, for that add the following

----
<build>
	<plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
        <artifactId>thorntail-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${version.thorntail}</version>
		... see more in pom.xml file	
      </plugin>	
	</plugins>
</build>
---- 

This project depends on following dependencies

----
<!-- This adds dependency on Teiid Fraction in Thorntail -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
  <artifactId>teiid</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- This adds dependency for Teiid's JDBC translator -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
  <artifactId>teiid-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Since we are using the MySQL database, we would need to add dependency on MySQL JDBC driver by adding the following

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>${mysql.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

if you want your Teiid instance to expose OData API, then add the following dependency

----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
  <artifactId>odata</artifactId>
</dependency> 
----

That completes the defining the `pom.xml`, now we need to define the VDB. 

== VDB Setup

Thorntail based Teiid currently only supports XML/DDL based VDBS with -vdb.xml extension. Develop your VDB completely using Desginer perhaps or simply using a text editor, once done place the VDB file in `src/main/vdb` folder.  

== Data Source Configuration
Data Source configuration is defined by Thorntail. You can see more information about this at http://docs.wildfly-swarm.io/2.0.0.Final/#configuring-a-datasource

This example provides a sample data configuration file in `src/main/resources` directory with name `project-local.yml` with content 

----
swarm:
  datasources:
    data-sources:
      accountsDS:
        driver-name: mysql
        connection-url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ACCOUNTS
        user-name: root
        password: my-secret-pw
----

where the above username and password and URL is built for the MySQL docker instance created above.

IMPORTANT: "accountDS" tag in above YML fragment is what defines the JNDI name that you can use on the VDB's "connection-jndi-name" attribute name in your <model> fragment. When this data configuration is run on Thorntail a datasource is created with JNDI name resolves to `java:jboss/datasources/accountsDS`. Make sure your names in here match with that of what you defined in the VDB.  

Now development/configuration is done.

== Build and Run the project

you can build the project by issuing the following the command

----
mvn clean package
---- 

this should build the project and if everything went well then it will create a  jar file with `-thorntail.jar` file in the `target` directory. You can run the application by running

----
java -jar target/rdbms-as-datasource-VERSION-thorntail.jar -S local 
----  

IMPORTANT: `-S local` at the end of command is denoting which configuration file to choose for configuration when application is ran. `-S local` chooses `project-local.yml` file. You can also have say `-S production` to choose a separate file `project-production.yml` file. You can also have multiple configurations, see Thorntail documentation on configuration resolution.

== Query Demonstrations

Now you can use any SQL client tools like SQuirreL or your own Java application and use Teiid JDBC driver and connect to the `Portrfolio` VDB and issue commands like (see simpleclient project for sample java code for client)

----
select SSN, FirstName, LasNname from Customer;
----

and see results as
----
CST01002	Joseph	Smith
CST01003	Nicholas	Ferguson
CST01004	Jane	Aire
CST01005	Charles	Jones
CST01006	Virginia	Jefferson
CST01007	Ralph	Bacon
----

If you enabled the OData, then you can use your browser and visit

----
http://localhost:8080/odata4/Portfolio.1/Accounts/CUSTOMER?$format=json
----

You will see results like

----
[{  
  "SSN":"CST01002",
  "FIRSTNAME":"Joseph",
  "LASTNAME":"Smith",
  "ST_ADDRESS":"1234 Main Street",
  "APT_NUMBER":"Apartment 56",
  "CITY":"New York",
  "STATE":"New York",
  "ZIPCODE":"10174",
  "PHONE":"(646)555-1776"
},
{  
  "SSN":"CST01003",
  "FIRSTNAME":"Nicholas",
  "LASTNAME":"Ferguson",
  "ST_ADDRESS":"202 Palomino Drive",
  "APT_NUMBER":null,
  "CITY":"Pittsburgh",
